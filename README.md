# [Doodle Jump]

In this Mini Project, I have created the Doodle jump game with html, css, and javascript. Specifically, I learned how to code the game using html5 canvas.

In making this project, I made the game loop, integrated images onto the canvas, set up click controls for doodler movement (both jumping and lateral motion), applied game physics, dynamically generated platforms and animated their descent, detected collisions between the doodler and platforms,  incorporated a live scoring system, and enabled game reset functionality.
